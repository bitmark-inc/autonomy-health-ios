You can adjust these coefficients above to assign different relative weights to the inputs.\n\nOur 3 data inputs are:\n\n1) A 14-day exponentially weighted average of the number of <b>daily confirmed infectious disease cases</b> in an area, as reported by the <corona-data-project>Corona Data Scraper project</corona-data-project>, which aggregates the latest public health data from verified sources around the world.\n\n2) A <b>symptoms score</b>, which is a normalized score calculated from the daily number of reported symptoms in a given neighborhood. Symptoms are assigned differential weights depending on whether they are known indicators of ongoing infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n3) A <b>behaviors score</b>, which is a normalized score calculated from the daily reported number of health-promoting behaviors in a given neighborhood.\n\nFor more information about exactly how we calculate our scores, please visit our <jupyter-notebook>Autonomy Score Jupyter notebook</jupyter-notebook>.";
